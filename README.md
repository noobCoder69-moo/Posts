# 📝 Posts – aka my glorified TodoList on steroids

welcome to **Posts**, a project that started as  
“lemme just learn django real quick”  
and ended up with me vibecoding half the frontend in react at 3am while surviving on instant noodles.

## ⚙️ tech stack
- **django** – the backend workhorse (aka python with a suit on).
- **react** – my chaotic attempt at looking like a frontend dev.  
- **sqlite** – because setting up postgres felt like doing taxes.  
- **rest framework** – the thing that makes json look sexy.

## 🤡 the journey
- googled “django tutorial”  
- copy-pasted urls like a pro  
- broke my app because i forgot a `/` in `<int:pk>/` (don’t laugh, it happens)  
- accidentally built a glorified todo app  
- told myself it’s actually a scalable microservice-ready enterprise-grade posting system™  
- vibecoded the frontend because why not — half the code is basically vibes.

## 🚀 running this beast
